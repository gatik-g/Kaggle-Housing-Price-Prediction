# Kaggle Housing Price Prediction Challenge

## Introduction

This repository contains my solution to the Kaggle Housing Price Prediction Challenge, where the goal is to predict the sale price of residential homes based on a variety of factors. The Kaggle Housing Price Prediction Challenge is a popular machine learning competition that provides a dataset of residential home properties and their corresponding sale prices. Participants are tasked with building a predictive model to estimate the sale price of a given house based on various features and attributes. This challenge is a good one to start with because it does not require any data cleaning because the data set is already cleaned and doesn't have any missing values.

More information about this challenge can be found on its Kaggle page here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

I attempted this challenge using a linear regression model and you can find my code in the jupyter notebook.

Feel free to use my code to work on your own submission!
